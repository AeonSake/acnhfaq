# Miscellaneous
## I heard a rumor that X might be added to the game. Is this true?
If Nintendo has not confirmed the feature/item from said rumor, then we cannot confirm if it will be added or not. However, fun and interesting things surface all the time whilst the dataminers are examining the game's code. Visit <http://acnhapi.com/trivia/> for some of this information.

## Is there a list that exists of every in-game item?
Yes! And more! Please visit <https://bit.ly/3gWAJDe> for a complete list of in-game items, recipes, villagers, and more.

## What's the drop rate for X material?
A lot of the rates can be found at <https://acnh.isomorphicbox.com/rates/#assortment-of-rates-and-information>.
