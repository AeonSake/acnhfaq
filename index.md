## Island Development
### What defines a week and a day in-game?
An in-game week begins on Monday at 5:00 AM, and is when your weekly NPC visitor schedule and Nook’s Cranny items are determined. An in-game day begins at 5:00 AM and ends at 4:59 AM the following day.

### Can I move where buildings are on my island?
Yes! Every building and house can be moved except the airport and Resident Services.

### How do I unlock terraforming?
Complete Project K by raising your island rating to 3 stars. Further information can be found under the “[Unlocking Things](#unlocking-things)” section.

### How do I raise my island rating?
Once you upgrade Resident Services and unlock the Project K quest, Isabelle will talk to you about increasing your island’s rating. To see a breakdown of how the island rating system works, read here: https://tinyurl.com/islandrating. In general, the best advice we can give is to listen to Isabelle, as she reviews your island in real time and can provide feedback on the areas you’re lacking. That said, it’s always a good idea to put out lots of furniture (both purchased and crafted) and plant lots of flowers and trees!

<!-- ### What can secondary (non-Island-Representative) players do?
I believe the answer to this is "everything except story progression", but check on this and finalize later. -->

### How do I get "X" DIY recipe?
There's a lot of different ways to get DIYs, so it depends on what you're looking for! Here's all the ways you can obtain a DIY:
- Villagers crafting
- NPCs (Celeste, Jack, Pascal, Zipper, Leif, and Cyrus)
- Balloons
- Snowboy
- Self-taught (includes King Tut mask, pitfall seed, trash DIYs, etc.)
- NookStop (purchase with Nook Miles)
- Nook's Crannies
- Message bottle

You can view [this page](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13d_LAJPlxMa_DubPTuirkIV4DERBMXbrWQsmSh8ReK4/edit#gid=2132424485) to help you search for the specific recipe you may be looking for.

### How long do villagers craft for? How many can craft per day?
Up to 3 villagers can craft per day. The first villager starts crafting when you log into the game for the first time that day, then they rotate every 3 hours. 

### What do I do with duplicate DIYs?
Up to you! Some people save them to trade them to other players, some sell them to Nook's Cranny, and some just toss them.

## Turnips/Stalk Market
### When does Daisy Mae visit?
Once you've built Nook's Cranny, Daisy Mae will visit every Sunday from 5:00 am to 12:00 pm. No NPC or event interrupts her arrival. 

### How does the Stalk Market work?
Daisy Mae’s prices change every time she visits, and you can buy turnips for *90 to 110 bells per turnip*. If you choose to purchase them, you can sell turnips to Nook's Cranny until Saturday (after which they will rot). Nook's Cranny can buy turnips for prices from *9 to 660 bells per turnip*. Nook’s Cranny prices change at 12:00 pm for a total of 2 distinct prices per day. The goal is to sell your turnips for *more* than you spent on them to make millions! 

For further, extensive details about turnips and the stalk market, read here: https://tinyurl.com/acnhturnipdoc

### Stalk Market Tips
- There are varying turnip price patterns, and you can predict the pattern using https://turnipprophet.io/, which uses your prices to predict what future prices might be later in the week.
- If you have a Nintendo Switch Online subscription, you can travel to others’ islands for a guaranteed high price. Suggested websites to find high prices: https://turnip.exchange, ACNH Discord Server (https://discord.com/invite/acnh). 
- Don't let your turnips rot! You can't unspoil them, and Nook’s Cranny will not buy rotten turnips. Make sure you sell by the following Saturday. Otherwise, they'll spoil Sunday morning at 5:00 AM. 

### How do I time travel for good turnip prices?
Your turnip price pattern resets every time you time travel. If you want to fish out big spike price with TT, follow this method:
1. TT to Tuesday at 11:58 AM and check your price.
2. If the price is not anywhere within the 127-225 range, save and quit. TT back to 11:57 AM, re-login. Repeat this step until the sell price is in that 127-225 range.
3. When the price is within the 127-225 range, wait in game until 12:00 pm, then check the price again.
4. If the price is not high enough, return to Step 1.

### How do I do turnip runs?
Turnip runs are a simple process but can be easily used to make tens of millions of bells. The process requires a **Nintendo Switch Online subscription** and a partner. 

1. One person time travels until they find a high turnip price at Nook’s Cranny (see: “How do I time travel for good turnip prices?”). 
    - Aim for 300+ bell prices—the higher the better.  
2. The other person time travels until they find a low buy price from Daisy Mae. (Simply travel to Sunday, back a day, and forward again until you find your desired price.) 
    - Aim for <95 bells price.
3. Buy a full inventory from Daisy Mae, travel to the Nook’s Cranny and sell. Rinse, repeat, make money!

## Villagers
### How many villagers are there in Animal Crossing: New Horizons?
Currently there are 391 villagers in AC:NH. See [here](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Villager_list_(New_Horizons)) for a list of them.

### How many villagers can I have?
You can have ten animal villagers and up to eight human villagers.
 
### How do I get a specific villager?
Unfortunately there’s no 100% guaranteed way to get a specific villager unless you have their Amiibo card or adopt them from someone else’s island. Your other options are to use NMT to find them on mystery islands, or hope they visit your campsite!

### How do I make a villager move out?
Please refer to Yue’s move-out guide here: https://yuexr.github.io/acnh/moveout.html.

### Will my villagers move out without telling me?
No. They always need to ask you for your permission before they move out.

### Can my most recently moved-in villager ask to move out?
No. It is 100% impossible for them to request to move out.

### Does hitting a villager/pushing a villager/talking to a villager until they get the purple squiggly/reporting the villager to Isabelle make them more likely to ask to move out?
No. Anyone claiming that these methods increase the likelihood of villagers asking to move out have been misinformed. 

### How often does someone visit my campsite?
Campsite visitors are determined on a percent chance roll, where the chance is based on when your last campsite visitor was. 

| Days Since Last Campsite Visitor | Chance of Campsite Visitor |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| 1-2                              | 0%                         |
| 3                                | 5%                         |
| 4                                | 10%                        |
| 5                                | 15%                        |
| 6+                               | 20%                        |

Meaning for every day starting the 6th day after your last campsite visitor, there is a 20% chance another campsite visitor will appear. Note that campsite visitors are not date-based, so time traveling to a date that you previously had a camper will not work to spawn another one. For more information on campsite see [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c8rsKWWtwsOo_JOxwO-lVRx2MUhc-bcdZg1mhXgtRPg/edit).

### What are the villager personalities?
There are 8 villager personalities.

| Male   | Female        |
|--------|---------------|
| Smug   | Normal/Sweet  |
| Jock   | Uchi/Sisterly |
| Cranky | Snooty        |
| Lazy   | Peppy         |

Special NPCs do not have personalities, and each villager can only be of one personality. Personality dictates the DIYs a villager crafts, the reactions they teach, the dialogue they can use, and more.

### What is friendship/What are friendship levels?
“Friendship” refers to how close you are with your villagers. Talking to them, gifting them items, and completing quests for them all increases friendship. Villagers also have friendship levels, and when you unlock new levels, you unlock new interactions and quests! For more specific details, visit Yue’s friendship guide, located here: https://yuexr.github.io/acnh/friendship.html.

### What are reactions? 
Each villager personality allows you to unlock reactions—these are the emotion animations your character can display. Unlocking them all takes time, so be patient! The infographic below shows which reactions are unlocked based on which personalities. You need a villager of that personality living on your island to unlock those specific reactions. 

For example, if you have no peppy villager, you cannot learn the aggravation, curiosity, happiness, sleepy, or mischief reactions. You can, however, always move out a villager once you’ve obtained all of their possible reactions!

All personality-based reactions: ![Reaction Infographic](/assets/reactions.png)

As of version 1.5.0, there are two event reactions, **Haunt** and **Scare** which are obtainable by playing the Halloween event. 

### What are Amiibos? Who has an Amiibo? 
Amiibos are Nintendo-produced collectibles that come in the form of cards or figurines and allow players to unlock special features when scanned into games. You can buy them from some online retailers or secondhand. In Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Amiibos allow you to invite villagers onto your island or unlock posters, an in-game item. There are 456 Animal Crossing Amiibo cards, including non-villager NPCs, villagers, and special villagers (such as the Sanrio x Animal Crossing villagers). 

All villagers have Amiibo cards except the following: Raymond, Dom, Sherb, Cyd, Reneigh, Audie, Judy, and Megan. (These 8 were introduced into the franchise in New Horizons, and thus do not have Amiibo cards or figures.) The NPCs Wilbur, Orville, Harvey, Lloid, Flick, C.J., Daisy Mae, Gullivarrr, and Wisp also have no Amiibos. 

Note: Amiibo villagers are in no way different from NMT island villagers. They are the exact same.

### How do I invite a villager to live on my island using their Amiibo?
Once you unlock the campsite (see [here](#building-unlocks) on how to unlock it), visit Resident Services and interact with the Nook Stop. On the initial menu, the option to “Invite \[Amiibo\] Camper" should appear. Select it and touch your Amiibo card to your right joystick. Your villager will appear in your campsite as soon as you close out of the Nook Stop. 

After you speak to them in the campsite, the villager will ask you to craft an item for them, occasionally teaching you a new DIY in the process. Repeat this process 3 times (invite camper, craft requested item) will allow you to ask them to move in on their third visit! The 3 days need not be consecutive. You can also juggle up to 8 in-progress amiibo scan-ins at a time; that is, if you scan in a 9th amiibo villager without completing the previous quests, the game will begin to delete its memory of the earlier camper visits.

## NPC Visitors and Special Characters

To participate, talk to Flick and pay 500 bells. Each round lasts 3 minutes—the goal is to catch as many bugs as possible in order to earn points. The points you earn in total (across all Bug-Offs) amass to a certain trophy—bronze for 100 points, silver for 200 points, and gold for 300 points. These trophies can only be earned once per player. 

The points can also be used to redeem items, of which there are 13. Once you have collected all 13, you will start to receive duplicates. Redeeming points for items (10 points each) does not detract from the trophy total.  

Each bug you catch adds 1 point to your total and each fish after the first three adds a bonus 2 points. The bugs you catch will immediately appear in Flick’s bug cage. He will also buy them from you for 1.5x the regular selling price. If you play with others, you will receive bonus points and waive the 500 bell fee.

If you give him lollipops, he’ll give you the Spooky Carriage and Spooky Wand recipe. You can also give candy to villagers that are outside to get furniture and recipes from the spooky set and lollipops. Villagers will teach you the scare reaction after you give them a piece of candy and likewise, Jack will teach you the haunt reaction. If you don’t have candy when a villager comes up to you, they will give three pieces of candy the first time. But everytime after that or if you don’t give them candy, they will change your bodypaint, eye contact color, and face paint, called a "trick". You can get more candy from villagers that are inside of their house by talking to them while wearing a scary costume. If you wear jack’s outfits while talking to villagers, they will also give you candy. It doesn’t matter if they are outside or inside, but you can only do this once per villager.

## Time Travel
### What is time travel?
Animal Crossing games are based on real time -- for example, things that the game says will take one day truly take one real-life day to complete. "Time traveling" refers to the act of manually changing the time of the game to either be in the future or go back to the past. 

Time traveling is *not* considered hacking. Time traveling also does not reverse/rewind progress. You keep all the progress, items, etc. that you've completed/acquired even if you time travel backwards.

### How do I time travel?
To time travel, you must either close your game or go to the ‘Save Complete’ screen after doing a ‘Save and End’.
You now need to change your date in your Switch settings:	
1. Open System Settings, System, Date and Time.
2. Disable ‘Synchronize Clock via internet’ if it is ON.
3. Go to Date and Time and adjust to whatever time you would like.
4. Return to the game and the new date & time will take effect!

### What are the effects of time traveling *forwards*?
It is important to remember that time traveling forwards is no different than closing your game and then logging in at the new, manually input time. With that said, here are the effects of going forwards.

Negative Effects:
- Weeds and flowers will grow/spread.
- Cockroaches may appear in your house (1+ month).
- You may get the bedhead animation (1+ month).
- Villagers may ask/comment on where you have been.
- Open plots may fill.
- Turnips will spoil *if* you time travel past the following Sunday.

Positive Effects:
- Building construction/upgrades/moves will be completed.
- All stock (Able Sisters, Nook's Cranny, Nook Shopping) will refresh.
- Weeds and flowers will grow/spread.
- Rocks and trees will refresh.
- Mail is delivered.
- Turnip price trend will not change. 

### What are the effects of time traveling *backwards*?
Negative Effects:
- Open plots may fill.
- Turnips will spoil.
- Turnip prices will change and your trend will be reset.
- Watered effect will be removed from flowers and they will not grow/breed.
- Campers will leave.

Neutral Effects:
  - It will not count as a "new day" in terms of progression.
  - Villagers will not advance moving in/out.
  - Building construction/upgrades/moves will not be completed.
  - Shop stock will be the same as it was the first time you visted that day unless you leave the current week.
  - Rocks and trees will not refresh.
  - Mail will not be delivered. 
  
  Positive Effects:
  - The daily recipe bottle will respawn.
  - Fossils will respawn.
  - NPC visitor shops and quests will refresh.
  - ABD chain will remain, and you can claim another daily bonus.

### What happens to my other games when I time travel for AC:NH?
Time traveling for AC:NH will not affect other time-based games unless you launch them whilst the system time is changed.

### Do I have to wait to time travel after someone invites my villager to live on their island?
No, and likewise, you don't have to wait to time travel after inviting someone else's villager to live on your island either.

### Can I time travel to play events that have passed?
Yes! Currently, all past ingame events have **not been locked** and are still accessible with time travel. Future events (ones _nobody_ has experienced) and future seasonal Nook Shopping items are still inaccessible ingame. 

All events (with the exception of Seasonal DIY events, New Year's, Fishing Tournaments, and Bug-Offs) are currently locked to 2020 and will not work in future/past years. The May Day Tour is once per user, but you can still access the event on secondary accounts. 

Player birthdays can only be experienced once every ingame year; TTing back to the same birthday date won't restore it, you'd have to go to a future or past year.

### How do I time travel to farm an NPC visitor?
If the NPC is on a weekday EXCEPT Monday:
 - TT to 4:58am on the same day of NPC. At 5am, it will change to new day and NPC will be there

If the NPC is on a Monday:
 - TT forward a day to Tuesday, then go back to Monday (after 5am)

### Will my villagers move out if I time travel too much? 
Nope! Though this was something that could happen in past installments of the game, villagers in New Horizons will not move out unless you give them explicit permission to do so.

### Will my villagers dislike me/lose friendship points if I time travel too much
Nope! They may have some dialogue about your disappearance if you do a big jump forward, but time traveling has no effect on friendship.

### Do the developers know I time travel? Will they do anything to me about it?
There is actually a variable turned up by data mining called "isTimeSly" that determines whether or not the player has time traveled! With that said, there's no indication whatsoever that the developers care, as there are no permanent in-game consequences or punishments for time traveling. Ultimately, it is your game, and you should play it however you want to!
