# Friendship
“Friendship” refers to how close you are with your villagers. Talking to them, gifting them items, and completing quests for them all increases friendship. Villagers also have friendship levels, and when you unlock new levels, you unlock new interactions and quests! For more specific details, visit Yue’s friendship guide, located here: <https://yuexr.github.io/acnh/friendship.html>.

{: .caution }
Note that the guide is outdated in terms of when certain interactions unlock as of `1.6.0`. The table below shows what villagers can approach you for and how likely they are to do so. More ticks means they are more likely to do that specific activity.

## How do I know which friendship level am I at with a villager?
Once per day, you can ask Katrina on Harv's commune to reveal your friendship with one of your villagers, see [the table available here](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/island-dev/harveyisland/#what-does-divining-friendship-do) for more details.

You can also use this document: <https://tinyurl.com/ACNHFriendshipDoc> (written and datamined by Stoney#9215) to determine your friendship level with your villager. If you need assistance or have questions about this document, please ask them in [our Discord server!](https://discord.gg/DAmpHqRBzq).

Additionally, you can ascertain which level of friendship you are on with other villagers by the interactions you have unlocked with them. The table below summarises these interactions.

| Friendship Level | Will gift you presents | Will give you nicknames | Will sell you items | Will ask to change catchphrase | Will buy items from you | Will trade for items | Will ask to change greeting |

## What are the friendship level thresholds?
The table below shows the various friendship levels and their point thresholds.

| Friendship Level |  Points   |
|:----------------:|:---------:|
|        1         |  0 - 29   |
|        2         |  30 - 59  |
|        3         |  60 - 99  |
|        4         | 100 - 149 |
|        5         | 150 - 199 |
|        6         |    200    |

## Can I lower friendship levels?
No, you are only able to lower friendship **points**, but not the levels. Friendship points will only ever drop to the lowest possible of a certain level. 

## I found a lost item, what do I do with it?
If you haven't already been tasked with finding it as part of a quest, you'll have to figure who is the original owner. You could try to give it to a random villager, who will point you to the owner if it's not them... But! If you give back the lost item directly to the right villager on the first try, you'll gain more frienship points towards them!  
If you select "Investigate" on the item from your inventory, the description you'll get will give you a hint about the owner of the lost item:  
- If the description is only "Someone lost this...", then the item belongs to a villager below friendship level 3, usually a villager who recently moved in
- If you get one of the descriptions in the table below, this'll give you the personality of the owner.  

| | Book | Notebook | Bag 1 | Bag 2 |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Lazy** | A well-used, well-loved picture book. There are little broken bits of candy between the pages... | This looks like someone's diary. Is this stain from drool? Maybe they fell asleep on it while writing. | This pouch is stuffed with something that smells delicious and is probably full of sugar. | This pouch looks like it's starting to tear in places. It's a little sticky too. Did someone spill juice on it? |
| **Jock** | This book is hard to read. The pages are warped, like they've gotten wet before. I think it's an exercise book. | Somebody scribbled something on the cover in pencil. Looks like it reads, "xtreme xercises"? | A very simple bag...that's a tad open. I spot some gym clothes, I think. | A dusty, well-used bag. It vaguely smells like those minty sports creams that athletes use. |
| **Cranky** | There are lots of pictures of potted trees inside. It looks like an introductory guide to bonsai trees. | An old planner that's seen plenty of wear and tear. The last page has tally marks... They are up to 12 now. | A sturdy, old-fashioned sort of bag. It gets full points for utility and zero points for style. | This classic pouch was built with functionality in mind, nothing more. It's the work of a craftsman. Maybe. |
| **Smug** | It's a novel. The author was obviously trying to be fancy by using lots of foreign words. I don't get it. | The cover of the book says "Mi diario secreto." I get the feeling I shouldn't look inside. | It's a stylish bag. The complex design says more about style than it does about function. | A stylish bag that looks like it could be popular. Whether it actually is popular might depend on the owner... |
| **Normal** | This novel looks really difficult. It's the kind of book only a voracious reader would think to pick up. | It reads "My Journal" in tiny letters on the cover. It's hard not to, but I probably shouldn't peek inside. | An adorable handcrafted bag with something hard and rectangular inside. Maybe it's a book? | A bag with a simple design. I can tell it was painstakingly made by hand. |
| **Peppy** | It's a comic. There's a girl with big, sparkling eyes on the cover. She's probably the hero. | It's an autograph book, but it's covered with all kinds of sparkly stickers. It's making my eyes hurt. | A bag made from a soft printed fabric featuring cartoon characters. It's all lumpy from being packed too full. | A snappy bag covered with buttons and pins of different pop stars. |
| **Snooty** | It's one of those love stories that are so popular nowadays. It has a subtle aroma too. Or is that my imagination? | I think it's a personal planner. Every line is filled in with precise, perfect handwriting. Err...I should close this. | Maybe this is someone's makeup bag? It smells like lovely perfume. | A pretty bag that's been well-loved. It looks like it's been customized a number of times. |
| **Big Sister** | A book with pressed flowers inside. OH! It still has the price sticker on it! | This looks like somebody's notebook. The handwriting is mostly illegible, but I can make out the word "Band." | A stylish bag adorned with gold metal spikes. It's got attitude! | The front of the bag has embroidered lettering in gold thread. The words are..."Bikers Are More Fun." |
