# Gifting
Gifting is the act of giving your villagers presents. This can be done **once** daily, and is the primary way of raising friendship once the interaction for gifting has been unlocked. There are several nuances to gifting, and this section will aim to address those.

## Is there any gameplay related benefit to gifting villagers?
Yes, it increases your [friendship level](/acnhfaq/villagers/friendship#what-is-friendshipwhat-are-friendship-levels) with them. For more info on gifting, please refer to Yue's gifting guide here - <https://yuexr.github.io/acnh/gift.html>.

1. Wall-mounted furniture is not safe even though it's not visibly displayed, because enough of it will overload a villager's inventory to the point where they will start removing wall-mounted furniture and surface furniture. 
2. Birthday-gifted/mailed shoes don't get physically placed but go directly to their wardrobe.  
3. Birthday-gifted/mailed rugs don't get physically placed but are stored in their inventory.
4. Although you can't hand-gift vaulting pole, ladder, villager photos, or posters, mailing these will actually cause them to get added to their inventory.

## If I complete X quest for my villager, will they keep that item in their inventory?
It depends on the type of quest and friendship levels! These are the storing rules for quests:
- Buy/Trade an item from your pockets: Always stored
- Appreciation or Apology Gift: Always stored
- Wrongly Delivered Item Return 
  - Friendship level 1-2: Always stored
  - Friendship level 3-4: Stored 70% of the time
  - Friendship level 5-6: Never stored
- Left Item Return
  - Friendship level 1-2: Always stored
  - Friendship level 3-4: Stored 70% of the time
  - Friendship level 5-6: Never stored
- Borrowed Item Return: Never stored
- Catch Request: Never stored

{: .note}
If you are asked to deliver a present, but you open said present before delivering it, the item will never be stored by the recipient.

## My villager wears clothing I gifted them, how do I reset it?
- Villagers' gifted clothing can be removed via giving them over 24 wearable clothing items, as 24 is the limit for clothing a villager can hold.
- Accessories can be replaced by gifting them 24 *non-glasses* accessories (e.g. bubblegum). 
- Hats (no helmets): in the game exist two tags for hats, free and womanly. Male villagers will only use hats tagged as free and gifting them 24 womanly hats will replace other hats from their storage. Since female villagers can use both types of hats, the only way to remove them is when they approach you to sell/gift/trade the item. For information on clothing tags, visit <https://bit.ly/3gWAJDe>.
- If you wish to remove a custom design, please read [here](/acnhfaq/npc/permanent#isabelle).
- Note: Villagers may place any gifted item (including tops) in their homes as mannequins in their house.

## My villager placed a furniture item (or a mannequin of a clothing) I gifted them in their house, how do I remove it?
You cannot remove the furniture/mannequin, but you can replace it using [this guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Iql5J5BXG-SuJvtw_duLZzjIw5myGcFnEL-I3BSR_CE/edit?usp=sharing). Replacing mannequins forces the clothing item (if wearable) to go into the villager's clothing inventory and thus be able to wear it.

{: .note}
As of `1.7.0`, clothing can now be placed on surfaces, and hence overflowing furniture storage wont remove clothing on surfaces. Caps and Accessories can't be overflowed with other clothes to be removed since they won't be removed if there are 4 or less of either of them. The only way to remove them completely is to **wait for the villager to gift you them on approach**.
