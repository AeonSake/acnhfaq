# Villagers
The AC community commonly refers to animal island residents as 'villagers'. Below are some terms commonly used to describe villagers or are related to villagers.

|Term|Meaning|
|-|-|
|Gifted|Gifted villagers have been given gifts or wear custom designs displayed on Able's back wall. They tend to be less desirable to other players in comparison to ungifted villagers. They can never be ungifted, only have their gifts replaced.|
|Ungifted|Ungifted villagers tend to be *higher value*, completely default villagers — they only wear their original outfits and have an untouched house—as if they were found from a mystery island.|
|Dreamies|Dreamies are a player's set of, or singular, personal favourite villagers. They are highly sought after by the player.|

## How many villagers are there in Animal Crossing: New Horizons?
Currently there are 397 villagers in AC:NH. See [the Nookipedia's entry here](https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Villagers/New_Horizons) for a list of them.

## What are the villager personalities?
There are 8 villager personalities.

| Male   | Female        |
|--------|---------------|
| Smug   | Normal/Sweet  |
| Jock   | Uchi/Sisterly |
| Cranky | Snooty        |
| Lazy   | Peppy         |

Special NPCs do not have personalities, and each villager can only be of one personality. Personality dictates the DIYs a villager crafts, the [reactions they teach](/acnhfaq/island-life#what-are-reactions), and the dialogue they can use.

## What are villager subtypes?
Each personality has two subtypes, A and B. Each personality type will define how a villager will speak to you. They also have differing interests and hobbies. 

Please refer to [this document on personality subtypes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b2rrEIeNZKnQrvoyD4JtkKSNJs2VAHobCBGKSnO2A_o/edit) for more information.

## How many villagers can I have?
You can have **10** animal villagers and up to **8** human villagers. You can only have one animal villager with same name on the same island.
 
## How do I get a specific villager?
Unfortunately there’s no 100% guaranteed way to get a specific villager unless you have their Amiibo card or adopt them from someone else’s island. Your other options are to use NMT to find them on mystery islands, or hope they visit your campsite!

## How do I extend the time window my villager is in boxes (or) How do I extend the duration my plot is empty?
[Time travel](/acnhfaq/tt) a few hours backwards, but stay within the same day.

## Do I *need* to have all 8 personalities on my island?
No, you don't. There are some benefits to having all 8 personalities, such as unlocking all of the [reactions](/acnhfaq/island-life#what-are-reactions) as well as easily getting all the villager-crafted DIYs. The game also encourages personality diversity by personality-locking your first 6 villagers:
- Villagers 1 and 2 are Jock and Uchi
- Villagers 3-5 are Peppy, Normal, and Lazy
- Villager 6 is Smug

That said, there's no requirement to do this, and you should have the villagers on your island that you enjoy the most! 

## When does X villager wake up/go to bed?

| Personality |        Time        |
|:-----------:|:------------------:|
|    Lazy     | 8:00 AM – 11:00 PM |
|    Jock     | 6:30 AM – 12:30 AM |
|   Cranky    | 9:00 AM – 3:30 AM  |
|    Smug     | 7:00 AM – 2:00 AM  |
|   Normal    | 6:00 AM – 12:00 AM |
|    Peppy    | 7:00 AM – 1:30 AM  |
|   Snooty    | 8:30 AM – 2:30 AM  |
|  Sisterly   | 9:30 AM – 3:00 AM  |
