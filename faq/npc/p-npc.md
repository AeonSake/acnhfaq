Complaining to her does NOT impact odds of moving out nor impact friendship whatsoever.

- The way they dress: Resets the villager's custom design as long as it is currently displayed in your Able Sisters. If the villager came from a foreign island, you have to have them wear a design from your Able Sisters to be able to reset it.
