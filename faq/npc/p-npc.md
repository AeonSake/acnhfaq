## Tom Nook <span><img src="https://alexislours.github.io/img/NpcIcon/rco.png" id="inv-icon"></span>
- Helps you navigate the tutorial phase of the game, and is the point of contact for construction-related queries.
- If you aren't sure what to do, talk to him and choose "What should I do?" If he doesn't have anything for you today, he may have something for you tomorrow! 
- He is also the NPC who is in charge of critical decisions. Access this menu by pressing the <span class="icon-minus"></span> button while on the game title screen. 

## Timmy and Tommy (The "Nooklings")
- Until [Nook's Cranny](/acnhfaq/unlocks#building-unlocks) is unlocked, you can buy and sell items from Timmy in the Resident Services tent.
- Timmy and Tommy run Nook's Cranny once it's built, where you can purchase decor, plants, and tools.

## Blathers
- Unlocked when you donate 5 critters to Tom Nook during the tutorial.
- Once the [museum](/acnhfaq/unlocks#building-unlocks) is built, you'll be able to donate bugs, fish, sea creatures, and art that Blathers will tell you about as well as display for players to look at. 

## Isabelle
- Unlocked when you upgrade [Resident Services](/acnhfaq/unlocks#building-unlocks) into a building.
- Isabelle handles daily announcements and is the point of contact for resident concerns, island evaluations, and personalizing your island's flag and tune.
- You can talk to Isabelle to reset villagers' clothing, catchphrases through the 'Discuss a Resident' option. 

{: .note}
Complaining to her does NOT impact odds of moving out nor impact friendship whatsoever.
- The way they talk: Resets custom catchphrases, but NOT nicknames or greetings.
- The way they dress: Resets the villager's custom design as long as it is currently displayed in your Able Sisters. If the villager came from a foreign island, you have to have them wear a design from your Able Sisters to be able to reset it.

## Pascal
- Appears in the sea when the player finds a scallop, given he hasn't already been given a scallop for the day.
- Will give Mermaid DIYs, clothing, or a pearl in exchange for the scallop you catch.
- Limited to one exchange with Pascal per day.
- See [the guide here](https://yuexr.github.io/img/pascal2.png) for more info on Pascal.

## Harvey (Harv)
- Will wander around your island upon first encounter.
- Speaking with him will prompt him to invite you to his own island, which allows you to take photos of your villagers and decorated sets.
- Speak to Orville in the airport to fly to Harv's island.
- Harv's island is the location for the [Wedding event](/acnhfaq/events#wedding-season).

## Orville and Wilbur
