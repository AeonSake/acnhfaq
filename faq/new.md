> *Feel the heat with the colorful Festivale event filled with dancing and flying feathers! On Feb. 15, Dancer Pavé will arrive to your island’s plaza** to usher in some confetti and carnival spirit. On the day of the event you can capture colorful feathers floating on your island with your net and trade them to Pavé to receive a passionate dance number in return. Rainbow feathers seem to be an especially rare sight, so be sure to catch them and trade them with Pavé. Invite friends over to your island or visit theirs to partake in the festivities together.*

Festivale has returned as an event on the **15th of February 2021**, the event is time-locked and would require version `1.7.0a`. Decorate with furniture bought from Nook's Cranny and wear extravagant costumes from Able Sisters. These new items will be available from February 1st onwards.
