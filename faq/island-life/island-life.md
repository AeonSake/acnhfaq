# Island Life
## What should I do during the first week of the game?
Follow this guide, <https://tinyurl.com/acnhtutorial/>.  

## How can I become friends/best friends with other people? What can they do on my island?
Visit <https://tinyurl.com/acnhfriends>.

## How do I visit other people/invite visitors over?
Starting day 2 of the game, speak with [Orville](/acnhfaq/npc/#orville-and-wilbur) in the airport and choose `I wanna fly!` to visit someone, or `I want visitors.` to open your gates for people to visit you. In order to use the `Online Play` options, you will need to have an active Nintendo Switch Online subscription. NSO is a paid subscription that you can purchase through the E-Shop that allows you to use the online features of various games, including AC:NH. If you have a friend that is physically close to you (i.e., in the same room or building), you can also choose the `Local Play` option! This option does not require the internet or an NSO subscription, but still allows you to visit other islands. 

## What defines a week and a day in-game?
An in-game week begins on Monday at 5:00 AM, and is when your weekly NPC visitor schedule and Nookâ€™s Cranny items are determined. An in-game day begins at 5:00 AM and ends at 4:59 AM the following day.

## How can I get 8 hits from a rock?
Dig two holes diagonally in one of the corners around the rock. Stand in the corners and hit the rock with a shovel. You should be able to hit the rock 8 times without being knocked away. See below for an example.

## What does eating fruit/turnip/cupcake/candy/lollipop do?
After you eat one, you can dig up a tree or break a rock. If you break a rock, one will respawn per day if there's a place it can spawn. You can get rid of the effect by sitting on a toilet.  

## What determines the weather on my island?
The weather on your island is determined by your weather *seed*. A seed is a special number generated at the creation of your island that determines a specific pattern. In this case, your weather pattern for the entire game. Weather includes things like shooting stars, rainbows, thunderstorms, etc. If you are interested in finding out what your weather seed is, visit <https://wuffs.org/acnh/weather/>.

Your weather pattern is permanent and unchanging. This means if you were to see a rainbow at 1:00 PM on June 1st, 2020, you would always see a rainbow at that time on that day if you were to time travel there. This is helpful to know for [meteor showers/shooting stars](/acnhfaq/island-life/stars/#when-will-i-see-meteor-showers).

## What is the spawn rate of X critter?
For the spawn rates of **ocean fish**, visit <https://tinyurl.com/OceanFishSpawn>.

For the spawn rates of **river fish**, visit <https://tinyurl.com/riverfishspawn>.

For the spawn rates of **deep sea creatures**, visit <https://tinyurl.com/seafoodspawn>.

The spawn rates for **bugs** are a bit more complex to calculate, so we recommend referring to the [data spreadsheet](https://bit.ly/3gWAJDe) and comparing their base values relative to other bugs. 

## What are the dimensions of X building?

## What does X villager's house look like?
Please visit <https://tinyurl.com/villagerintext> for a complete list of villager interiors and exteriors!

<!-- TODO: Ninji's website is out of date, either use Ahri's (which is out of date but less so), or find another resource -->
## What are the different mystery islands and what can I find on them?
Please visit <https://wuffs.org/acnh/mysterytour.html> for a complete list of them.  
Additionally, there is a 30% chance of finding fossil, as well as a 30% chance of finding a DIY message bottle per island. You can always find one wasp's nest and a piece of furniture from shaking a non-fruit tree. If you have an empty, unsold plot, you can also find a random villager. See [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16yHQzdYx4VznhnKSGZdtaKi_Yo8NpDwCYK8dmpR481s/edit) to learn about how the game determines the villager. See [here](https://acnhapi.com/nmt-calculator/) for figuring out your chances of finding a specific villager.

## Dreams
### How do I dream?
Go to a bed indoors and lie down. Select `I want to sleep`. This will allow you to enter the dream world and meet Luna! From there, select `I want to dream` and then enter a dream address!  

### How do I get my dream address?
Go to a bed indoors and lie down. Select `I want to sleep`. From there you will meet Luna! Select `Share a dream` to receive your dream code.  
Your weather and time in the dream will be same as when you upload the dream.

### What can you do in a dream?
You can explore other user's islands at your own leisure to get inspiration or talk to different villagers! Any changes made by visitors will NOT affect your real island and visitors can NOT take anything from a dream!

## Swimming
### How do I swim?
First you need a wetsuit, they can be bought from the cabinet in Nook's Cranny or ordered from the nook stop under Redeem Nook Miles. Once you have a wetsuit, face the ocean and press `A`. To swim faster hold `A` and when you see bubbles, select `Y` to dive and catch a sea creature.

### How to catch fast sea creatures?
If you are having trouble catching a sea creature because it is moving too quickly you could try approching it without holding `A` then selecting `Y` when you are near enough to dive and catch it. Or you could try swimming towards it and making it move into the corners of the net since they can't go past it.

### Who is Pascal?
If you catch a scallop and it's the first scallop of that day caught, an NPC named [Pascal](/acnhfaq/npc#pascal) will appear and ask for the scallop, if you tell him yes, then he will give you either a pearl, a mermaid furniture diy, or mermaid clothing that will go directly into your pockets if you have enough pocket space.
