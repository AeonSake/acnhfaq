# Island Life
## What should I do during the first week of the game?
Follow this guide, <https://tinyurl.com/acnhtutorial/>.  

## How can I become friends/best friends with other people? What can they do on my island?
Visit <https://tinyurl.com/acnhfriends>.

## How do I visit other people/invite visitors over?
Starting day 2 of the game, speak with [Orville](/acnhfaq/npc/#orville-and-wilbur) in the airport and choose "I wanna fly!" to visit someone, or "I want visitors." to open your gates for people to visit you. In order to use the "online play" options, you will need to have an active Nintendo Switch Online subscription. NSO is a paid subscription that you can purchase through the E-Shop that allows you to use the online features of various games, including AC:NH. If you have a friend that is physically close to you (i.e., in the same room or building), you can also choose the "Local Play" option! This option does not require the internet or an NSO subscription, but still allows you to visit other islands. 

## What defines a week and a day in-game?
An in-game week begins on Monday at 5:00 AM, and is when your weekly NPC visitor schedule and Nookâ€™s Cranny items are determined. An in-game day begins at 5:00 AM and ends at 4:59 AM the following day.

## How can I get 8 hits from a rock?
Dig two holes diagonally in one of the corners around the rock. Stand in the corners and hit the rock with a shovel. You should be able to hit the rock 8 times without being knocked away. See below for an example.

## What does eating fruit/turnip/cupcake/candy/lollipop do?
After you eat one, you can dig up a tree or break a rock. If you break a rock, one will respawn per day if there's a place it can spawn. You can get rid of the effect by sitting on a toilet.  

## What determines the weather on my island?
The weather on your island is determined by your weather *seed*. A seed is a special number generated at the creation of your island that determines a specific pattern. In this case, your weather pattern for the entire game. Weather includes things like shooting stars, rainbows, thunderstorms, etc. If you are interested in finding out what your weather seed is, visit <https://wuffs.org/acnh/weather/>.

Your weather pattern is permanent and unchanging. This means if you were to see a rainbow at 1:00 PM on June 1st, 2020, you would always see a rainbow at that time on that day if you were to time travel there. This is helpful to know for [meteor showers/shooting stars](/acnhfaq/island-life/stars/#when-will-i-see-meteor-showers).

## What is the spawn rate of X critter?
For the spawn rates of **ocean fish**, visit <https://tinyurl.com/OceanFishSpawn>.

For the spawn rates of **river fish**, visit <https://tinyurl.com/riverfishspawn>.

For the spawn rates of **deep sea creatures**, visit <https://tinyurl.com/seafoodspawn>.

The spawn rates for **bugs** are a bit more complex to calculate, so we recommend referring to the [data spreadsheet](https://bit.ly/3gWAJDe) and comparing their base values relative to other bugs. 

## What are the dimensions of X building?

## What does X villager's house look like?
Please visit <https://tinyurl.com/villagerintext> for a complete list of villager interiors and exteriors!

<!-- TODO: Ninji's website is out of date, either use Ahri's (which is out of date but less so), or find another resource -->
## What are the different mystery islands and what can I find on them?
Please visit <https://wuffs.org/acnh/mysterytour.html> for a complete list of them.  
Additionally, there is a 30% chance of finding fossil, as well as a 30% chance of finding a DIY message bottle per island. You can always find one wasp's nest and a piece of furniture from shaking a non-fruit tree. If you have an empty, unsold plot, you can also find a random villager. See [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16yHQzdYx4VznhnKSGZdtaKi_Yo8NpDwCYK8dmpR481s/edit) to learn about how the game determines the villager. See [here](https://acnhapi.com/nmt-calculator/) for figuring out your chances of finding a specific villager.

### How do I get my dream address?

## How can I find X seasonal material?
- See [here](https://bigfootmg.github.io/ACNH-Plant-Guide/07.png) for young spring bamboo, cherry blossom, acorns, pine cones, maple leaves, and mushrooms.  
- Summer shells are found on the beach and more spawn every five minutes.
- Snowflakes flow around you island and can be caught with a net.
- Ornaments drop from decorated cedar trees. They will only appear after Isabelle announces their presence. See [here](/acnhfaq/tt/#i-time-traveled-to-festive-season-but-why-are-none-of-the-cedar-trees-decorated) for how to get them. 
- Note for acorns, pinecones and ornaments: you can simply shake one tree infinitely until it produces the amount you want.

## How do I build a perfect Snowboy?
It is important to note that size is not the determining factor in how a perfect Snowboy would be, but rather its proportions. The head should be about **10-20% smaller than the body** for it to be considered perfect. The table below shows the correlation of the head to body ratio and its rating.

| Head          | Rating        |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| <60%          | Worst         |
| ~60%          | Not Good      |
| ~70%          | Good          |
| **~80-90%**   | **Perfect**   |
| 100%          | Good          |
| ~110%         | Not Good      |
| >110%         | Worst         |
  
If estimation is not your forte, a general guideline for the perfect Snowboy is to have the top of the Snowboy's body to be the same height as the top of the player's eyes, while the Snowboy's head should be the same height as the bottom of the player's ears. See below for a visual example. Perfect Snowboys reward a Frozen DIY and 1 large snowflake to their builder, and a Frozen DIY to other island residents that speak with them on the day they are built.

### Where can I find snowballs?
From testing (courtesy of *Stoney#9215*), Snowballs will spawn in a **6x6 area of empty grass tiles**, though the area can be smaller or partially occupied depending on what you put there. The first snowball will usually be in the middle of this area, and the second snowball will spawn close by. The second snowball does not seem to be governed by the same spawning rules as the first snowball, as it can appear to spawn on custom designs, in flower/weed fields, as well as paths. 

If you have destroyed your snowballs, entering and exiting a building will usually respawn snowballs. At times it requires the game to be closed before they can respawn.

### Other Snowboy mechanics!
- Only one Snowboy can be built per day.
- If other residents (i.e., residents that did not build the Snowboy) speak to a **perfect** Snowboy on the day they were built, they are also awarded a DIY, or 1 large snowflake if they know all Frozen DIYs.
- If the Snowboy built is the first one ever by the player, the builder will be awarded a Frozen DIY and 1 large snowflake regardless of perfection.
- If the Snowboy is perfect, the builder is rewarded a frozen DIY and 1 large snowflake. However: 
  - If the player speaking to the Snowboy knows all Frozen DIYs prior to building, the Snowboy will only give them 1 large snowflake. 
  - If the builder knows all Frozen DIYs prior to building, ***and*** has crafted one of each DIY, the Snowboy will mail them a crafted Frozen item.
  - For each subsequent day the perfect Snowboy is spoken to by the builder, they will give 1 large snowflake.
- If the Snowboy is **not** perfect, they will not give anything to the builder nor other residents on any day they are present on the island.

***Special Case:*** If a player has at least a tent but hasn't learned how to craft yet, then they'll get mailed the DIY on the first Snowboy. **This is the only way to obtain the recipe cards for trading purposes.** For subsequent perfect Snowboys, the player will only receive 1 large snowflake until they learn to craft.
