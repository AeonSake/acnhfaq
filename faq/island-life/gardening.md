## Rock Gardens
A rock garden is a carefully planned layout of rock formations. You can manipulate where rocks can spawn by utilising blockers which will be discussed in detail in the guide linked.

### Can all 6 of my rocks be in the same grid quadrant?
Yes they can. It is a myth that there is a limit to how many rocks can be on a single grid quadrant.

### Why are some of my rocks not spawning?
If you are making a rock garden, it's usually something south of the garden blocking the spawn. Check the rock garden guide, for what it might be.  
You need to remove it until the rock spawn.

## Pumpkins
### How to I find pumpkin starts?
<span><img src="https://alexislours.github.io/img/MenuIcon/SeedlingVegetable.png" id="inv-icon"></span> Pumpkin starts can be bought from [Leif](/acnhfaq/npc#leif) <span><img src="https://alexislours.github.io/img/NpcIcon/slo.png" id="inv-icon"></span>throughout the year. During the month of October, it can also be bought from Nook's Cranny, as well as half off from Leif.

### Do I need to water pumpkins?
No watering is required for the pumpkins' growth, but watering it during every day of its growth stage will increase its yield, to a maximum of 3 pumpkins per harvest.
