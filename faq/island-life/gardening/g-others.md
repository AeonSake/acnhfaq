# Other Gardening Mechanics
## Rock Gardens
A rock garden is a carefully planned layout of rock formations. You can manipulate where rocks can spawn by utilising blockers which will be discussed in detail in the guide linked.   
<https://cestislife.github.io/rockguide>

### Can all 6 of my rocks be in the same grid quadrant?
Yes they can. It is a myth that there is a limit to how many rocks can be on a single grid quadrant.

### Why are some of my rocks not spawning?
If you are making a rock garden, it's usually something south of the garden blocking the spawn. Check the rock garden guide, for what it might be.  
You need to remove it until the rock spawn.

## Trees
### What types of trees are there?
There are 6 types of trees in total, for more details, see: <https://bigfootmg.github.io/ACNH-Plant-Guide/#Tree%20Types>

|Tree Type|Description|

|<span><img src="https://alexislours.github.io/img/MenuIcon/PltMoney.png" id="inv-icon"></span><br>Coconut|• Bury bells in glowing spots to grow.|

### Why aren’t my trees growing?
Trees have 5 growth stages. A tree will grow 1 stage per day as long as there are fewer than 12 trees at stage 2 or higher (or stage 1 or higher fruit trees) within a 9x9 tile area centered on the tree that is growing. If you are having trouble with stunted trees, move them to a more open area and replant them when they are fully grown. For more details, see: <https://bigfootmg.github.io/ACNH-Plant-Guide/#Tree%20Growth>

### What items drop from trees?
Hitting trees with an axe will drop the three types of wood. Shaking a tree will drop wasp nests, furniture, coins, sticks, and sometimes bugs. For more info on tree drops, see: https://bigfootmg.github.io/ACNH-Plant-Guide/#Tree%20Drops

### How do I grow money trees?
Everyday there will be a spot on your island that is glowing. If you dig that spot, you will get a bag of 1000 bells. If you bury bells in the hole while it is glowing, it will create a money tree sapling. The amount of money you can harvest from the money tree when it is fully grown depends on how many bells you bury, and rng. It is recommended to only plant 10k bell bags to make money trees for the highest profits over time. For more details, see: <https://bigfootmg.github.io/ACNH-Plant-Guide/Extras.html#Money%20Trees>

## Ornament Trees:
### Why aren’t my trees decorated?
Cedar trees can become decorated only from Dec 15 to Jan 6, in both hemispheres. 50% of the cedar trees on your island will be decorated. 
NOTE: Prior to version 1.6.0, you needed to have at least 22 hardwood and cedar trees inorder for cedar trees to become decorated, because trees filled with items could not become decorated. This has been changed so that 50% of all cedar trees, regardless of any items that were in the tree, will become decorated.
 
### Can I transfer/move them?
No, digging up a decorated tree will cause it to become a normal cedar tree. You can rearrange your cedar trees, and then reload the game it will redecorate 50% of your cedar trees. It is still RNG based, but you can change which trees are decorated this way. There is currently no way to choose which trees get decorated.

For full information on decorated trees and ornament drop rates, see: <https://bigfootmg.github.io/ACNH-Plant-Guide/Extras.html#Ornaments>

## Fruits
### What are my “native” and “sister” fruits?
There are 5 types of fruits from fruit trees: apples, cherries, oranges, peaches, and pears, and coconuts from palm trees. Your native fruit is the type that is naturally found on your island, and sold in your Nook’s Cranny. Your sister fruit is the type found when you go to mystery islands.

### How do I get the other fruits?
At some point early in the game you will get a random fruit mailed from Mom. This can get you a third fruit type. The other 2 types you will have to get by trading with other players. Coconuts and bamboo can be found on mystery islands.

## Shrubs/Bushes
### How do I get Shrubs?
Shrubs can be bought from Leif, who will sell one type that is in-season and one random type that is out-of-season. Only in-season shrubs will bloom.

## Weeds
### What are they for?
Weeds grow naturally on your island and are used as crafting materials for a few DIY recipes.

### How do I stop them from growing?
Weeds will stop spawning or growing if there are 150 or more weeds on your island.

### What are the different types/forms of weeds?
There are 3 variants of weeds, with 3 growth stages, the variants change appearance depending on the season. These variants are purely visual, there is no difference between them. When you plant a clump of weeds a random variant is spawned at stage 1.

For more information on weeds, see: <https://bigfootmg.github.io/ACNH-Plant-Guide/#Weeds>

## Pumpkins
### How do I find pumpkin starts?
Pumpkin starts can be bought from Leif throughout the year. During the month of October, they can also be bought from Nook’s Cranny, as well as from Leif for half price.

### Do I need to water pumpkins?
No watering is required for the pumpkins’ growth, but watering it during every day of its growth stage will increase its yield, to a maximum of 3 pumpkins per harvest.

For more information on pumpkins, see: <https://bigfootmg.github.io/ACNH-Plant-Guide/Extras.html#Ponkimps>

## Mushrooms
### Where do Mushrooms spawn?
Mushrooms will spawn next to trees that have valid tiles. Only 5 can spawn per day, and up to a maximum of 30 naturally spawned mushrooms can be on your island. Mushrooms cannot be planted but they can be dropped. Dropped mushrooms do not count towards the 30 mushroom maximum.
 
### What types of mushrooms are there?
There are 5 types of mushrooms that have different spawn rates based on your island rating.
