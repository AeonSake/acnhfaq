## Common FAQs
### Do I need to buy the DLC for the other profiles on a single Switch?
No, only one person needs to own the DLC for it to be available for every profile on the same Switch.
### Will the HHP island be shared with other profiles on the same Switch?
No, each profile will get their own instance of HHP. Progression is not shared between profiles. 
### Is there a limit to how many houses you can design?
The limit is quite literally how many villagers there are in the game currently. You are able to create vacation homes for all 413 villagers and all the special NPCs, e.g. Isabelle, Pascal, Flick, etc. 
### How do I kick clients out of HHP?
You cannot, this is by design. It is intended that you build vacation homes for all available villagers ingame. 
### What happens to my villager if I invite them with souvenir chocolate?
You will invite a "copy" of the villager to Paradise Planning. Your original villager will be intact.
### Can I change the roommate of client?
Yes, speak to the client you wish to ask to leave. They will then ask for you to build a vacation home for them if they do not already have one. 
### Can I remodel or change the name of any of the facilities I've built?
Yes, speak to Lottie about facilities and she will guide you through the process. You are prompted to either retain the name or change it once you're done remodelling.
### How do I change the staff working at the facilities?
Press <span class="icon-arw-Left"></span> when you are at the facility you wish to change the staff of. This is also where you can change their outfits. 
### What are the materials needed for the other variants of the pillar, low island counter and tall island counter DIYs?
After unlocking the ability to donate to Niko's box on the second floor of the Paradise Planning Office, donating materials in his box will allow him to give you a new set of interior construction DIYs. The materials required by Niko vary from player to player, so check the Materials Box to see what you need to donate.
