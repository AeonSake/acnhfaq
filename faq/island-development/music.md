# Music & Island Tunes
## When do I get the hourly music?
The hourly music is unlocked once you have completed the prologue and unlocked the Resident Services building.

## Why does music sound different on event days?
Event days have their very own special soundtrack to signify the day is, well, special. This will last throughout the event being active.

## How do I change the island tune?
You can change the island tune by talking to Isabelle. Note that there is no reset button, so if you wish to save the island's default island tune, do remember to take a screenshot before changing.

## Music Players
### What kind of music players are there?
There are several types of music players, and they have their own speaker type which dictates their sound quality. The types are: cheap, phono, retro and hi-fi. The table below lists the available music players and their speaker types in the game as of `1.6.0`.

### How do I put music in the music players?
You would need a [K.K.](/acnhfaq/npc#kk-slider) Track to be able to put music in your music players. Talking to K.K. will allow you to request a song from him. Doing so will prompt a performance, and afterwards he will give you a copy of the song. Additionally, you can request specific songs from K.K., which is how you obtain "secret songs". The table below denotes the various moods you can choose and the songs that he can play by choosing that mood.

{: .note}
It is important to key in the exact name of the song you are requesting, down to the correct capitalisation and spaces. Failure to do so, or requesting a non-existant track will prompt K.K. to play the invalid songs (`Hazure01`, `Hazure02` or `Hazure03`) which do not have a take-home track.

Table below shows all K.K. songs and their corresponding moods:
