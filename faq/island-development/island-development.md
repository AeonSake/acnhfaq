# Island Development
## How long does it take for X to be built?
One [day](/acnhfaq/island-life#what-defines-a-week-and-a-day-in-game) after you ask for it to be built.

## How do I move where buildings are on my island?
Once Resident Services has been upgraded, you can ask Tom Nook to move a building by selecting "Let's talk infrastructure." > "I want layout changes.", this will cost you 10,000 bells. To move your own house, you'll have to ask "About my home..." > "I want to relocate." and the fee will be 8,000 bells.


Tom Nook will give you a building move kit that you can them place outside where you want the building to be. The new and old position of a building can't overlap, in that case you'd have to do it in 2 different moves (and twice the price) over two days. If you change your mind before placing the move kit, you can cancel the move by talking to Tom Nook again and choosing the "Let's talk infrastructure." > "I want layout changes." > "Let's not move it." (or "About my home..." > "I don't want to move." if it was for your own house), he'll then take the kit back and refund you your bells

*Note:* The airport, Resident Services/plaza and empty housing plots can not be moved in any way.

*Note 2:* You must have spoken at least once to a villager to introduce yourself to them to be able to move their house. You cannot move the house of a villager if they're in boxes.

## What is the build limit for buildings/structures?

| Building/Structure | Build Limit |
|:------------------:|:-----------:|
|    Player Homes    |      8      |
|   Villager Homes   |     10      |
|      Bridges       |      8      |
|      Inclines      |      8      |

## How do I unlock terraforming?
Complete Project K by raising your island rating to 3 stars. Further information can be found under the [Unlocking Things](/acnhfaq/unlocks) section.

## What can secondary (non-Island-Representative) players do?
Secondary residents can do everything that Island Representatives can except story progression and certain infrastructural decisions. They can interact with and complete quests for NPC visitors, upgrade/relocate their house, raise friendship with villagers, buy/sell items, donate to the museum, terraform, place decorations, invite new villagers from mystery islands or from other players, and donate to construction efforts.

They *cannot* buy bridges or inclines, move buildings, or progress the story (i.e., upgrade Resident Services from a tent to a building, build the campsite, etc).

- You can view [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13d_LAJPlxMa_DubPTuirkIV4DERBMXbrWQsmSh8ReK4/edit#gid=2132424485) to help you search for the specific recipe you may be looking for.

\**Note*: Nature Day activities were **removed** from the game as of version `1.10.0.` This method of obtaining the hedge fence is now only viable if you are version `1.9.0` or below.

### How long do villagers craft for? How many can craft per day?
Up to 3 villagers can craft per day. The first villager starts crafting when you log into the game for the first time that day; they rotate every 3 hours. Villagers won't craft on event days (e.g. bug-off, fishing tourney, etc.).

### What do I do with duplicate DIYs?
Up to you! Some people save them to trade them to other players, some sell them to Nook's Cranny, and some just toss them.

## Snowboys
### How do I build a perfect Snowboy?
It is important to note that size is not the determining factor in how a perfect Snowboy would be, but rather its proportions. The head should be about **10-20% smaller than the body** for it to be considered perfect. The table below shows the correlation of the head to body ratio and its rating.

| Head          | Rating        |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| <60%          | Worst         |
| ~60%          | Not Good      |
| ~70%          | Good          |
| **~80-90%**   | **Perfect**   |
| 100%          | Good          |
| ~110%         | Not Good      |
| >110%         | Worst         |
  
If estimation is not your forte, a general guideline for the perfect Snowboy is to have the top of the Snowboy's body to be the same height as the top of the player's eyes, while the Snowboy's head should be the same height as the bottom of the player's ears. See below for a visual example. Perfect Snowboys reward a Frozen DIY and 1 large snowflake to their builder, and a Frozen DIY to other island residents that speak with them on the day they are built.

![Snowboy Guide](/acnhfaq/assets/snowboy_guide.jpg)

### Where can I find snowballs?
From testing (courtesy of *Stoney#9215*), Snowballs will spawn in a **6x6 area of empty grass tiles**, though the area can be smaller or partially occupied depending on what you put there. The first snowball will usually be in the middle of this area, and the second snowball will spawn close by. The second snowball does not seem to be governed by the same spawning rules as the first snowball, as it can appear to spawn on custom designs, in flower/weed fields, as well as paths. 

If you have destroyed your snowballs, entering and exiting a building will usually respawn snowballs. At times it requires the game to be closed before they can respawn.

### Other Snowboy mechanics!
- Only one Snowboy can be built per day.
- If other residents (i.e., residents that did not build the Snowboy) speak to a **perfect** Snowboy on the day they were built, they are also awarded a DIY, or 1 large snowflake if they know all Frozen DIYs.
- If the Snowboy built is the first one ever by the player, the builder will be awarded a Frozen DIY and 1 large snowflake regardless of perfection.
- If the Snowboy is perfect, the builder is rewarded a frozen DIY and 1 large snowflake. However: 
  - If the player speaking to the Snowboy knows all Frozen DIYs prior to building, the Snowboy will only give them 1 large snowflake, provided they have not crafted every DIY at least once. 
  - If the builder knows all Frozen DIYs prior to building, ***and*** has crafted one of each DIY, the Snowboy will mail them a crafted Frozen item.
  - For each subsequent day the perfect Snowboy is spoken to by the builder, they will give 1 large snowflake.
- If the Snowboy is **not** perfect, they will not give anything to the builder nor other residents on any day they are present on the island.

For more information, please visit <https://bigfootmg.github.io/Snowboys/index.html>

{: .note}
If a player has at least a tent but hasn't learned how to craft yet, then they'll get mailed the DIY on the first Snowboy. **This is the only way to obtain the recipe cards for trading purposes.** For subsequent perfect Snowboys, the player will only receive 1 large snowflake until they learn to craft.

## Balloons
### When does a balloon spawn and what do they drop?
![Balloons](https://cestislife.github.io/img/balloons.png)

### How do I farm balloons?
Balloons can be funneled through tall objects, making them much easier to farm as you won't miss any that spawn. To do this, follow the steps outlined below:
1. Find the direction your balloons are coming from. You can do this by looking at the direction smoke is blowing out the top of a house's chimney.
2. Craft or purchase many tall objects (at least 30 units tall). For a list, see here: <http://tinyurl.com/acnh-tallfurni>
    - We recommend jail bars, as they're wide!
3. Line the coast of your island where the balloons are entering, leaving a space at the bottom for the balloons to come through. If you have a river mouth on that side of your island, that can become the opening as well. You do not need to terraform cliffs for this to work.
4. Sit by your opening and wait. Balloons *can* spawn on the XX:X4 and XX:X9 minutes, with an estimated spawn rate of about 50%. Put on some music and farm those balloons!

Here's a visual of what your coast might look like, courtesy of `Nours#7244`!

## How do I unlock all the DAL items? What are the milestones?
Dodo Airlines will reward you with merchandise when you have collected enough "DAL Points" and reached the point thresholds. There are two ways to earn these points, namely:
- 1 point for the first flight of the day to either Harv's island or a mystery island
- 1 point for each flight to another player's island. This can be flights to the same island.

{: .note}
There is a maximum of **3 points** that you are able to accumulate each day.

The DAL rewards and point thresholds are listed in the table below:

| Item             | Points Required |

You are only able to get these rewards **once** from DAL. Any additional you may require would need to be traded from other players, as all of the things are  not reorderable from Nook Shopping.
