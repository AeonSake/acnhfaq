# Harvey's Island
Harvey's Island is a separate island accessible by using Dodo Airlines. The island serves two functions: as a photo studio and as a commune for permanent co-op shops to be set up by various NPCs. It also serves as the location for the June wedding event.

## Photopia
Photopia is a photography studio where you can set up customised sets for photo opportunities. The furniture used to decorate here is based on your catalogue. Scanning amiibo here will also unlock that character's poster that will be available for order in Nook Shopping. 

## The Commune
The Commune is a new expansion introduced in `Ver. 2.0.0` which allows the player to set-up co-op shops of both existing, and new NPC vendors. To unlock the expansion:
- K.K. Slider must have performed
- You must have entered Photopia
- You must have talked to Harv on his island

### What are the co-ops available on The Commune?
There are 7 co-ops available to unlock. Each co-op requires a donation of 100,000 <span class="icon-Bells"></span>, paid to the respective Lloid on the designated spot, and only one co-op may be funded per day. The table below details what each co-op is and its purpose, clockwise starting from the first co-op on the left.

### Do the co-ops have closing times?
Most co-ops will close around midnight.

### When will the wares at the co-ops refresh?
The inventory of all co-ops refreshes weekly, on Monday. An exception to this is Redd, who will also replace art bought the previous day with another random art piece.

### How do I unlock the ABD at Harvey's Island?
The ABD machine will be installed automatically once you set-up the first co-op.

### What does Harriet do?
Harriet offers one new hairstyle per co-op unlocked. You can only obtain one new hairstyle per day.
