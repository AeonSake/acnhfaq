## Bug-Off
In the Northern Hemisphere, the Bug-Off occurs on the 4th Saturday of June, July, August, and September from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM. In the Southern Hemisphere, it occurs on the 3rd Saturday of November, December, January, and February from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM. 

To participate, talk to Flick and pay 500 bells. Each round lasts 3 minutes—the goal is to catch as many bugs as possible in order to earn points. The points you earn in total (across all Bug-Offs) amass to a certain trophy—bronze for 100 points, silver for 200 points, and gold for 300 points. These trophies can only be earned once per player. 

The points can also be used to redeem items, of which there are 13. Once you have collected all 13, you will start to receive duplicates. Redeeming points for items (10 points each) does not detract from the trophy total.  

Each bug you catch adds 1 point to your total and each bug after the first three adds a bonus 2 points. The bugs you catch will immediately appear in Flick’s bug cage. He will also buy them from you for 1.5x the regular selling price. If you play with others, you will receive bonus points and waive the 500 bell fee.

To participate, talk to C.J. and pay 500 bells. Each round lasts 3 minutes—the goal is to catch as many fish as possible in order to earn points.

These trophies can only be earned once per player. 

The points can also be used to redeem items, of which there are 13. Once you have collected all 13, you will start to receive duplicates. Redeeming points for items (10 points each) does not detract from the trophy total.  

Each fish you catch adds 1 point to your total and each fish after the first three adds a bonus 2 points. The fish you catch will immediately appear in C.J.’s cooler box. He will also buy them from you for 1.5x the regular selling price. If you play with others, you will receive bonus points and waive the 500 bell fee.
