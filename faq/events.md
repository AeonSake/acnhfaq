# Events
{: .no_toc }
Events are special days where (in most cases) a special NPC will arrive on the island to host said event. You will be rewarded in some form or another, either with furniture, DIYs, or even reactions. Events are usually **time-locked**, that is, they will only be available when they are unlocked on the actual date of the event in realtime (which we will term as [BCAT or NTP unlocks](/acnhfaq/tt#what-are-bcat-or-ntp-unlocks)). 

Time travelling to these events will not be possible, unless of course the actual event day has passed. In this case, you are free to time travel back to a past event to redo them.

There are several requirements for most of the events listed here:
- You must have an upgraded Resident Services.
- You must not have a banned Nintendo Switch (as they cannot receive BCAT unlocks).
- You must connect your profile to a Nintendo Account.
- You must be connected to the Internet.

## Bug-Off
In the Northern Hemisphere, the Bug-Off occurs on the 4th Saturday of June, July, August, and September from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM. In the Southern Hemisphere, it occurs on the 3rd Saturday of November, December, January, and February from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM. 

To participate, talk to Flick <span><img src="https://alexislours.github.io/img/NpcIcon/chy.png" id="inv-icon"></span> and pay 500 bells (except for the first round, which is always free). Each round lasts 3 minutes — the goal is to catch as many bugs as possible in order to earn points. The points you earn in total (across all Bug-Offs) amass to a certain trophy — <span><img src="https://alexislours.github.io/img/FtrIcon/FtrTrophyInsectBronz.png" id="inv-icon"></span> bronze for 100 points, <span><img src="https://alexislours.github.io/img/FtrIcon/FtrTrophyInsectSilver.png" id="inv-icon"></span> silver for 200 points, and <span><img src="https://alexislours.github.io/img/FtrIcon/FtrTrophyInsectGold.png" id="inv-icon"></span> gold for 300 points. These trophies can only be earned once per player. 

The points can also be used to redeem items, of which there are 13. Once you have collected all 13, you will start to receive duplicates. Redeeming points for items (10 points each) does not detract from the trophy total.  

Each bug you catch adds 1 point to your total and each bug after the first three adds a bonus 2 points. The bugs you catch will immediately appear in Flick’s bug cage. He will also buy them from you for 1.5x the regular selling price. If you play with others, you will receive bonus points and waive the 500 bell fee.

## Fishing Tourney
The fishing tourney occurs on the 2nd weekend of April, July, October, and January from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM. The dates do not vary across hemispheres. 

To participate, talk to C.J. <span><img src="https://alexislours.github.io/img/NpcIcon/bey.png" id="inv-icon"></span> and pay 500 bells (except for the first round, which is always free). Each round lasts 3 minutes—the goal is to catch as many fish as possible in order to earn points. The points you earn in total (cumulative across all Fishing Tourneys in any island) amass to a certain trophy — <span><img src="https://alexislours.github.io/img/FtrIcon/FtrTrophyFishBronz.png" id="inv-icon"></span> bronze for 100 points, <span><img src="https://alexislours.github.io/img/FtrIcon/FtrTrophyFishSilver.png" id="inv-icon"></span> silver for 200 points, and <span><img src="https://alexislours.github.io/img/FtrIcon/FtrTrophyFishGold.png" id="inv-icon"></span> gold for 300 points. These trophies can only be earned once per player. 

The points can also be used to redeem items, of which there are 13. Once you have collected all 13, you will start to receive duplicates. Redeeming points for items (10 points each) does not detract from the trophy total.  

Each fish you catch adds 1 point to your total and each fish after the first three adds a bonus 2 points. The fish you catch will immediately appear in C.J.’s cooler box. He will also buy them from you for 1.5x the regular selling price. If you play with others, you will receive bonus points and waive the 500 bell fee.

## Festivale (Mardi Gras)

    <dd>All Day</dd>
    <dt>Rewards</dt>
    <dd>Festivale float, Rainbow Feather DIY, Feathers</dd>
  </dl>
</div>

Festivale requires version `1.7.0a`. During Festivale, feathers will be floating around your island, and you would then have to catch them with your net to grab them. The rainbow feather is rare but talk to Pavé <span><img src="https://alexislours.github.io/img/NpcIcon/pck.png" id="inv-icon"></span> to obtain the <span><img src="https://alexislours.github.io/img/FtrIcon/FeatherRainbow.png" id="inv-icon"></span> Rainbow Feather DIY if you have trouble getting them.  He will then ask you to give him 3 normal feathers of the same colour (red, blue, green, purple) or 1 rainbow feather in exchange for a dance performance from him, as well as a **random Festivale series furniture.** You can also exchange feathers with your villagers for a different colour. 

{: .note}
The variant of the furniture given depends on the colour of the feathers you give him.

After receiving 9 furniture items, he will then ask you to give him 3 rainbow feathers in exchange for the <span><img src="https://alexislours.github.io/img/FtrIcon/FtrCarnivalFloat.png" id="inv-icon"></span> Festivale float. This process can be repeated multiple times for multiple event rewards throughout the day.

Some other notes:
* **Festivale series furniture** are available in Nook's Cranny from February 1st to February 15th. The colour is based on your airport colour so:
  * Blue Airport - Red Festivale
  * Orange Airport - Purple Festivale
  * Yellow Airport - Blue Festivale
  * Green Airport - Green Festivale
* The **Festivale costumes** will start to appear in Able Sisters from February 1st to February 15th as part of the random selection.
* The **Viva Festivale Reaction Set** is available in Nook's Cranny cabinet from February 1st to February 15th and includes the **Feelin’ It**, **Let’s Go**, **Viva** and **Confetti** reactions.

Wilbur <span><img src="https://alexislours.github.io/img/NpcIcon/doc.png" id="inv-icon"></span> will bring you to an island with a hedge maze.

When you complete the maze, you can talk to Rover <span><img src="https://alexislours.github.io/img/NpcIcon/xct.png" id="inv-icon"></span> and you'll get a reward mailed the next day: either <span><img src="https://alexislours.github.io/img/FtrIcon/FtrTrunkXct.png" id="inv-icon"></span> **Rover’s briefcase** if that was your first time meeting Rover, or <span><img src="https://alexislours.github.io/img/FtrIcon/BromideNpcSpXct_Remake_0_0.png" id="inv-icon"></span> **Rover's photo** if you already completed the (now unavailble) 2020 May Day maze.

You can also get up to nine <span><img src="https://alexislours.github.io/img/FtrIcon/BellExchangeTicket.png" id="inv-icon"></span> **Bell Vouchers** (worth 3,000 bells each), if you solve the maze completely, like Rover's reward, they will also be mailed to you the next day.

**Notes:**
- You can only do the tour once per character.
- If you ever get stuck in the maze, you can call Rescue services on your Nook Phone, this will reset the whole May Day maze which will allow you to restart from the beginning.

The "Czar of Halloween", Jack <span><img src="https://alexislours.github.io/img/NpcIcon/pkn.png" id="inv-icon"></span>, will pay a visit to your island. Jack will give you his outfit in exchange for <span><img src="https://alexislours.github.io/img/MenuIcon/Candy.png" id="inv-icon"></span> candies. If you give him <span><img src="https://alexislours.github.io/img/MenuIcon/Lollipop.png" id="inv-icon"></span> lollipops, he’ll give you the <span><img src="https://alexislours.github.io/img/FtrIcon/FtrHwnCarriage_Remake_0_0.png" id="inv-icon"></span> Spooky Carriage and <span><img src="https://alexislours.github.io/img/FtrIcon/ToolStickHalloween.png" id="inv-icon"></span> Spooky Wand recipe. You can also give candies to villagers that are outside to get furniture and recipes from the Spooky set and lollipops. Villagers will teach you the <span><img src="https://alexislours.github.io/img/ManpuIcon/AddPrank.png" id="inv-icon"></span> `Scare` reaction after you give them a piece of candy and likewise, Jack will teach you the <span><img src="https://alexislours.github.io/img/ManpuIcon/AddScaring.png" id="inv-icon"></span> `Haunt` reaction. 

If you don’t have candy when a villager comes up to you, they will give three pieces of candy the first time. But everytime after that or if you don’t give them candy, they will change your bodypaint, eye contact color, and face paint, called a "trick". You can get more candy from villagers that are inside of their house by talking to them while wearing a scary costume. If you wear Jack’s outfit while talking to villagers, they will also give you candy. It doesn’t matter if they are outside or inside, but you can only do this once per villager.
